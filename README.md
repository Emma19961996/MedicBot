# MedicBot
AN AI-POWERED HEALTHCARE CHATBOT
Model Summary
The model is built using the Gemma Causal Language Model (GemmaCausalLM), with a pre-trained version called "gemma_2b_en". The model is fine-tuned on a comprehensive medical Q&A dataset to answer a variety of health-related questions, including drug usage, dosage, diseases, treatments, and side effects.

This fine-tuned model is designed to generate accurate and contextually relevant answers to user queries, making it useful in medical or healthcare chatbot systems. LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) was applied during training to reduce the number of trainable parameters, improving efficiency without losing performance.

Usage
The model can be used in applications requiring real-time medical question-answering, such as medical chatbots, clinical support systems, or educational tools.
